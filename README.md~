# Storing, Retrieving, and Analyzing Social Media Data Using MongoDB#




##  Background Info ##
This assignment is built on top of the previous assignment.

We'd like to utilize the twitter data (raw formats) that you gathered in assignment 2. 

##Lexical diversity  ##
Lexical diversity is a measurement that provides a quantitative measure for the diversity of an individual's or group's vocabulary.  It is calculated by  finding the number of unique tokens in the text divided by the total number of tokens in the text. 

## 1-Storing Task ##


  1.1- Write a python program to automatically store the JSON files (associated with the #microsoft and #mojang hash tags) 
     returned by twitter api in  a database called db_streamT.
     
  1.2- Write a python program to insert the chucked data tweets (of assignment 2) that you have stored on S3 to mongoDB 
     in a database called db_tweets.

## 2-Retrieving and Analyzing Task ##
  2.1- Analyze the tweets stored in db_tweets by finding the top 30 retweets as well as their associated usernames and the locations 
   of users.
   
  2.2- Compute the lexical diversity of the tweets stored in db_streamT and store the results back to Mongodb. You need to create a collection 
    with appropriate structure for storing the results of your analysis.
    
  2.3- Write a python program to create a db called db_followers that stores all the followers for all the users that
     you find in task 2.1. Then, write a program to find the un-followed friends after a week for the top 10 users( users that have the highest number of followers in  task 2.1)
     since the time that you extracted the tweets.
     
  2.4- .(Bonus task) Write a python program and use NLTK to analyze the top 30 retweets of task 2.1 as positive or negative (sentiment analysis). This is the bonus part of the assignment.

##3-Storing and Retrieving Task##

  3.1- Write a python program to create and store the backups of both db_tweets and db_streamT to S3. It also should have a capability of
     loading the backups if necessary.
     

## What to Turn In ##
 
1. A link to your S3 bucket that holds the backups documented in your README.md file.  Make sure to make it publicly accessible.

2. Your python codes.

3. The plot of your lexical diversity in task 2.2 and the result of the sentiment analysis in task 2.4 if you complete the bonus part.
